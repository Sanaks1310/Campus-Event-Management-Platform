Registration (id, student_id, event_id, timestamp)  
Attendance (registration_id, present)  
Feedback (registration_id, rating 1-5)  

#Database Schema (tables)  
College (id, name)  
Event (id, college_id, title, type, date, capacity)  
Student (id, college_id, name, email)  
Registration (id, student_id, event_id, created_at)  
Attendance (id, registration_id, present)  
Feedback (id, registration_id, rating)  

#API Design  
POST /api/events -> create event  
POST /api/register -> register student  
POST /api/attendance -> mark attendance  
POST /api/feedback -> submit feedback  
GET /api/reports/* -> reports  

#Workflows  
Registration: Creates a Student record if one doesn't exist. Then, it creates a Registration record.  
Attendance: Updates the Attendance record for a specific registration to mark the student as present.  
Feedback: Creates a Feedback record and attaches a rating to a specific registration.  

#Assumptions & Edge Cases  
Duplicate Registrations: The system will prevent duplicate registrations by checking for an existing registration record for the same student on the same event.
